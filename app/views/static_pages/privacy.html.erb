  <h2>1. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>“YOUR COMPANY NAME HERE” may provide certain demographic information it collects to third parties in connection with its provision of Services to our Users. The dissemination of this information is necessary in order to provide personalized information and promotional offers. Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, our current policy is to refrain from selling, leasing, or otherwise transferring your personally identifiable information, however, this policy does not apply in all cases and this policy may be changed in the future. We describe below some of the situations in which such information may be disclosed. “YOUR COMPANY NAME HERE” will never provide our promotional affiliates with personally identifiable information which would permit them to communicate with our Users by email unless the User "opts-in" and have not "opted-out", pursuant to our opt-out procedure, from receiving communications.

We expect those promotional partners with whom we share information (with consent, as provided herein) to respect the privacy of our Users in the same manner as we do. However, we cannot ensure that they abide by our privacy policies.
    The information we collect may also include information you submit about others, including the name, e-mail address or physical address of a gift recipient. We only use information you submit about other people to deliver information, products, or services specifically requested by you or to cooperate with law enforcement officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our customers.</p>
  <h2>2. Information That Is Personally Identifiable</h2>
    <p>Our registration format requests certain contact information from our Users.

    <br/>• Unique identifiers ( including credit card numbers)
    <br/>• Demographic information (including zip code, telephone area code, age, birth date, gender, income level, etc.)
    <br/>
